# IRhard 1.0.1
Arduino library to decode NEC signals from an IR detector via hardware interrupt.

Now with a header-only version. The whole mess don't seem like it should be a library with a class that has no methods. The code has been consolidated to IRextInt.h in the examples folder with IRdemo.ino as an example. Everything else might be eliminated, unless there's a reason for it to be a class.
   
File structure might only include:  
 * README.md  
 * examples/IRdemo/IRextInt.h  
 * examples/IRdemo/IRdemo.ino  
 * examples/IRdemo/readme.txt
